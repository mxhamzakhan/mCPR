# Modern Contraceptive Use in India: A Data Analysis Using NFHS-V

## Project Overview
This project explores the prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive use in India using data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-V). The analysis highlights trends across states and identifies key factors that influence women's and couples' decisions regarding birth spacing and family planning.

## Tools Used :Â 
- **SPSS**
- **R**
- **Excel**
## Key Objectives
* Analyze modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR) across Indian states.
* Investigate factors such as education level, wealth index, place of residence, and community health worker visits that influence contraceptive use.
* Build a regression model to predict mCPR based on key demographic factors

## Methodology
*Data Source* : NFHS-V (2019-21) dataset.
*Data Analysis*:
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to assess state-wise mCPR.
  * Hypothesis testing using Chi-square tests to identify associations between contraceptive use and demographic variables.
  * Regression modeling to examine the impact of education, wealth, and health worker interaction on contraceptive use.
